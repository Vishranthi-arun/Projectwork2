## Knee Osteoarthritis Detection and Severity Classification using Deep Learning
The development of a deep learning-based system for Knee Osteoarthritis Detection and Severity Classification, aimed at automating the diagnosis process using X-ray images. This system leverages the Xception CNN model and Grad-CAM visualization to enhance accuracy and interpretability, providing a reliable computer-aided diagnostic (CAD) tool for healthcare professionals.

## About
Knee Osteoarthritis Detection and Severity Classification is a project designed to develop an automated system that utilizes deep learning techniques for accurate and efficient diagnosis of knee osteoarthritis (OA) from X-ray images. Traditional OA diagnosis relies on manual radiographic assessment, which is time-consuming, subjective, and prone to variability among radiologists. This project aims to overcome these challenges by implementing a computer-aided diagnostic (CAD) tool that can classify knee OA into five severity levels: Healthy, Doubtful, Minimal, Moderate, and Severe.

The system leverages the Xception deep learning model with transfer learning to enhance classification accuracy. Additionally, Grad-CAM (Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping) is incorporated to provide visual explanations, ensuring interpretability and trustworthiness in medical decision-making. The model is deployed via a Streamlit-based web application, enabling real-time analysis and a user-friendly interface for healthcare professionals.

By integrating deep learning, medical imaging, and interactive AI-powered diagnosis, this project contributes to the advancement of AI-driven healthcare solutions, facilitating faster, more consistent, and objective OA severity assessment.
